# My-React-Practice
Practicing React by playing with the basics of react. I am Utilizing the create-react-app for this project

There is the one main App.jsx Component within it i have put in a Content Component which contains the main Details for my App

The content component has Two other nested components in it namely Gender which is a Radio button List and a Salutation Component
which allows me to choose Gender

#Update: Also added a dynamic Input Component to be reusable

I have tried to keep components at a minute level like this so as to get a feel of react
